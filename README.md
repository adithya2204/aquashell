# aquashell
 A multi-mode underwater robot featuring a custom-designed shell and an assembly of open-source components. This project combines remote-controlled and autonomous operation, integrating advanced sensors (pressure, temperature, gyroscope), a camera, and automated buoyancy adjustment for stable underwater navigation. Powered by Raspberry Pi 4 and Arduino UNO, the robot utilizes ROS for multi-node task management and LiFi communication for reliable data transfer underwater. Designed with ABS for robust, watertight construction, the system is suitable for marine research, inspection, environmental monitoring, and educational applications. The shell is original work; other mechanical components are sourced from GrabCAD
